# Decision making with Matrices
# This is a pretty simple assingment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations.

# The problem is: you and your work firends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a resturant thats best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so eveyone is happier.

# Displicte the simplictiy of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.

# This process was thoughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approah can prove helpful on any number of decsion making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.

# The most imporant idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.
# Informally describe what a linear combination is and how it will relate to our resturant matrix.
# A linear combination is defined as "is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a 
# constant and adding the results" (or perhaps more intuitively scaling and adding the basis vectors) [Wikipedia]. 
# it is a linear combination becuase if you hold one of the two scalers and let the other change freely your result with be a 
# line. Sacling both of them lets you reach any point on the plane (For example, the span of most 2D vectors is all of 2D space).
# In relation to our resturant example we will find the linear combination that results in a maximum value across all resturants 
# and across all preferences. 

# Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant for them.  What does each entry in the resulting vector represent.
# I will calculate the top resturant for Kyle.
# The output vectors, called scores below, show my ranking of each resuturant based on my preference and the resturants features in realtion
# to my preferences. The resturant with the highest value is my top choice, the resturant with the lowest value is my last choice.
# Respectively these are: Curry Stop (top), Fish Market (last choice)

# To do

# Think of two metrics to compute the disatistifaction with the group.
# Percent of people where the choice is in the bottom half of resturants
# Delta between chosen resturant and top resturant
#
