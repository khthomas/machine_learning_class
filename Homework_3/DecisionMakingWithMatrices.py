# Decision making with Matrices
# This is a pretty simple assingment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations.

# The problem is: you and your work firends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a resturant thats best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so eveyone is happier.

# Displicte the simplictiy of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.

# This process was thoughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approah can prove helpful on any number of decsion making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.

# Transform the restaurant data into a matrix(M_resturants) use the same column index.

# The most imporant idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.
# Informally describe what a linear combination is and how it will relate to our resturant matrix.
# A linear combination is defined as "is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a 
# constant and adding the results" (or perhaps more intuitively scaling and adding the basis vectors) [Wikipedia]. 
# it is a linear combination becuase if you hold one of the two scalers and let the other change freely your result with be a 
# line. Sacling both of them lets you reach any point on the plane (For example, the span of most 2D vectors is all of 2D space).
# In relation to our resturant example we will find the linear combination that results in a maximum value across all resturants 
# and across all preferences. 

# Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant for them.  What does each entry in the resulting vector represent.
# I will calculate the top resturant for Kyle.
# The output vectors, called scores below, show my ranking of each resuturant based on my preference and the resturants features in realtion
# to my preferences. The resturant with the highest value is my top choice, the resturant with the lowest value is my last choice.
# Respectively these are: Curry Stop (top), Fish Market (last choice)

def get_scores(person, rests_matrix, rest_names_list):
    r_scores = np.matmul(person, rests_matrix.T)

    return r_scores, output, sorted_output

scores, kyle_favs, sorted_kyle = get_scores(kyle, M_resturants, rests)
kyle_top_choce = sorted_kyle[0]
kyle_last_choice = sorted_kyle[-1]

# Next compute a new matrix (M_usr_x_rest  i.e. an user by restaurant) from all people.  What does the a_ij matrix represent?
all_scores = np.matmul(M_people, M_resturants.T)
all_scores, all_favs, sorted_all = get_scores(M_people, M_resturants, rests)

# Sum all columns in M_usr_x_rest to get optimal restaurant for all users.  What do the entryâ€™s represent?

# Now convert each row in the M_usr_x_rest into a ranking for each user and call it M_usr_x_rest_rank.   Do the same as above to generate the optimal resturant choice.

# Why is there a difference between the two?  What problem arrives?  What does represent in the real world?

# How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem.

# Find user profiles that are problematic, explain why?

# Think of two metrics to compute the disatistifaction with the group.

# Should you split in two groups today?

# Ok. Now you just found out the boss is paying for the meal. How should you adjust. Now what is best restaurant?

# Tommorow you visit another team. You have the same restaurants and they told you their optimal ordering for restaurants.  Can you find their weight matrix?
