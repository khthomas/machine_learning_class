# Decision making with Matrices
# This is a pretty simple assingment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations.

# The problem is: you and your work firends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a resturant thats best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so eveyone is happier.

# Displicte the simplictiy of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.

# This process was thoughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approah can prove helpful on any number of decsion making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.

# The most imporant idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.
# Informally describe what a linear combination is and how it will relate to our resturant matrix.
#################################################################################################################################
# A linear combination is defined as "is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a 
# constant and adding the results" (or perhaps more intuitively scaling and adding the basis vectors) [Wikipedia]. 
# it is a linear combination becuase if you hold one of the two scalers and let the other change freely your result with be a 
# line. Sacling both of them lets you reach any point on the plane (For example, the span of most 2D vectors is all of 2D space).
# In relation to our resturant example we will find the linear combination that results in a maximum value across all resturants 
# and across all preferences. 

#################################################################################################################################
# Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant for them.  What does each entry in the resulting vector represent.
#################################################################################################################################
# I will calculate the top resturant for Kyle.
# The output vectors, called scores below, show my ranking of each resuturant based on my preference and the resturants features in 
# realtion to my preferences. The resturant with the highest value is my top choice, the resturant with the lowest value is my last 
# choice.
# Respectively these are: Curry Stop (top), Fish Market (last choice)

##############################################################################################################
# Why is there a difference between the two?  What problem arrives?  What does represent in the real world?
##############################################################################################################
# In my instance there is not a difference between the two. There is the problem of ties. Also the problem of ranking
# does not include how people value things, simply an enumeration of value. This seems easy, but it does not allow 
# for distances between choice to be made, or for easy comparison between two peoples rankings. We could say that there is
# a distance between two rankings, but that is the limit of comparison. You could not do any other valuation method, or 
# change weights in a different way to change the outcome.

##############################################################
# How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem.
###############################################################
# To start, I would not allow ties and perhaps limit the cumulative response that people can give. 

#######################################################
# Find user profiles that are problematic, explain why?
#######################################################
# I don't think there are profiles that are problematic per say. People have preferences and give weights accordingly. Some people
# could rank everything the same which does ot really helpy for their decsion making. For example giving everything a 10 or a 0 for
# all preferences says they don't really care. However, it can greatly impact the outcome of the math. There can be combinations of 
# preferences that are troublesome. For example, having one vegitarian in a group of people who love steak # houses can really cause 
# problems. 

# After ploting the results I see that Ruth has a high preference for many resturants and Mary has low preferences for all resturants.
# Mary bascially hates all resutrants except for the Fish Market. It seems that people could try to game the system and give weights
# that only help certain resturants, while harming others.
