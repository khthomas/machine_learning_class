A medical claim is denoted by a claim number ('Claim.Number'). Each claim consists of one or more medical lines denoted by a claim line number ('Claim.Line.Number').

1. J-codes are procedure codes that start with the letter 'J'.

     A. Find the number of claim lines that have J-codes.
     51029

     B. How much was paid for J-codes to providers for 'in network' claims?
     2418603.6867250004
     providers only 2418429.572825
     
     C. What are the top five J-codes based on the payment to providers?
     [('"J1745"', 434232.08058999985), 
      ('"J0180"', 299776.560765), 
      ('"J9310"', 168630.87357999998), 
      ('"J3490"', 90249.91245000002), 
      ('"J1644"', 81909.39601500018)]



2. For the following exercises, determine the number of providers that were paid for at least one J-code. Use the J-code claims for these providers to complete the following exercises.

    A. Create a scatter plot that displays the number of unpaid claims (lines where the ‘Provider.Payment.Amount’ field is equal to zero) for each provider versus the number of paid claims.
     See Attached Image (Q2A_Scatter.png)

    B. What insights can you suggest from the graph?
     Overall there are very few providers that tend to have a balance of paid vs unpaid j-codes. In fact most providers tend to have far 
     more unpaid vs paid claims. 

    C. Based on the graph, is the behavior of any of the providers concerning? Explain.
     Two of the providers have 0 payments, three providers have very few payments and lots of unpaid JCodes (FA0001387001, FA0001387002, FA0001389001).
     This implies that there are some providers taht are not paying out anything to their customers. There might be a reason for it though.



3. Consider all claim lines with a J-code.

     A. What percentage of J-code claim lines were unpaid?
     Approximately 88 percent (0.881087224911325)

     B. Create a model to predict when a J-code is unpaid. Explain why you choose the modeling approach.
     First I narrowed down the variables to use in the model. I did this by first discovering which numeric 
     variables were the most correclated with the target variable. Then I found categorical variables which 
     had relatively low cardnality (less than or equal to 20). I then ran all of this data through a custom
     function that made in total 10 models. Mostly I used variants of Logistic regression and Random Forests 
     so that I could understand variable importance. 

     C. How accurate is your model at predicting unpaid claims?
     Very accruate. The average model across the five folds of my best models was 99.9% accruate.
     I am suspecious of the accuracy and am worried that there is information leak somewhere in the model.


      D. What data attributes are predominately influencing the rate of non-payment?
      See the image Q3D_Feature_Importance.png for image. Also, there is a function called plot_feature_importance() 
      where you can insert an int for the top X attributes that influence the model.

      The top 5 attributes are:
      1. ServiceCode_"IJV" (0.672505)
      2. ProviderID_"FA0001774001" (0.044757)
      3. RevenueCode_"0250" (0.029762)
      4. NetworkID_"ITS000000004" (0.024498)
      5. PriceIndex_"E" (0.019325)
